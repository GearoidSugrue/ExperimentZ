You wake with a pounding headache, in up in what appears to be a derelict medical ward. Whats worse is that you just can't seem to remember who you are, perhaps the chart at the end of the bed has some clues. As you look around the room, it is clear that something is is wrong.
You think to yourself: "Perhaps I should stock up on some supplys and try get out of here".
