Dear Diary,
I've been having serious headaches the last few hours. Paracetamol hasn't really helped, I seem to be forgetting everything.
Ever since I met up with Michelle for a while earlier I've been feeling off. Maybe I'm just upset that we've to hide our relationship?
I don't know, I'll probably skip work tomorrow if I don't improve! I'm sure the rest of the kitchen staff can work without me. Anyway I better go finish my shift.
Talk Later,
