Day 28 of Testing:
The patients who were recovering have been cleared to leave the facility. They are not carrying the virus in any form and we don't expect any recurring problems.
We have not managed to isolate anti bodies as of yet. Infected patients are showing some aggressive behaviours and have scratched and attempted to bite nurses. Restraints have been put in place.
