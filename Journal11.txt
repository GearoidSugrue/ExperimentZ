Day 42 of Testing - evening:
Our main benefactor stupidly released a statement that we were close to curing cancer. The press have jumped have all over it so we're expecting media attention on our site. With the recent, and admittedly horrific occurrences on the site any media attention here would be disastrous. There still hasn't been a sign of a site wide outbreak which is excellent. Hopefully we can treat the virus.
