You hear the intercom turn on. A siren sounds and automated broadcast plays out over the speakers:
"WARNING. WARNING. SECURITY SYSTEMS DEACTIVATING, OUTBREAK IMMINENT!"
It is broadcasting a countdown. Countdowns are never good!!!
You see a map on the wall, there appears to be a control room in the north-east wing.
...
Better get to that control room!!!
