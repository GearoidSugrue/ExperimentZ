As you walk down the hallway, somebody jumps out of no where and trys to grab you. You let out a horrified scream. He doesn't respond to your pleas and continues to viciously attack you.
After a stuggle you finally push him off and he collapses to the ground. As you look closer you see his flesh is severely scared and damaged.
It's clear that there was something very wrong with him...
